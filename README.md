# Final Project

This repo contains [Jonas Markgraf's](https://github.com/jmarkgraf) and [Malte Berneaud-KÃ¶tz's](https://github.com/mberneaud) final paper and website of our research project in the Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis course at the Hertie School of Governance. 

**Instructor**: Christopher Gandrud

## Note regarding the data sets used in the analysis

This repo does not contain the necessary data sets needed to reproduce the analysis, as one data set is hand-collected and not intended for publication at this stage and the other one has to be bought at the Bavarian statistical office. 

As we do not intent to publish the data used in the analysis publicly, it needs to be manually inserted into the `data/`  directory. Otherwise, the RMarkdown will not render correctly as one of the earlier code chunks will throw an error right away. 


**Please Note**: The paper is based on and a part of a research project by Guillermo Rosas (Washington University in St. Louis; grosas(at)wustl.edu) and Jonas Markgraf (Hertie School of Governance; markgraf(at)hertie-school.org).
